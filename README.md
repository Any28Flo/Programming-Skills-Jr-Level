# Programming-Skills-Jr-Level
This repository contains 5 junior-level exercises for developers who wish to build cool projects for their portfolio and train skills that professional developers use during work. 




ATTENTION: These projects may vary in difficulty depending on your knowledge and experience. They are designed to be developed in the simplest way possible as they are junior level. Each of these projects can also be developed in web3 using blockchain. As a junior developer, you should learn to work in a team, so to successfully complete this challenge, you should follow the instructions below:

1. Choose a role: Back-End Dev or Front-End Dev
2. Team player! You must choose a teammate with the opposite role who will work in collaboration with you.
3. You can develop these projects for web 2.0 or web3 according to your profile.
4. Feel free to contribute, make observations, or let me know if you find any errors.
5. Enjoy coding! :)
